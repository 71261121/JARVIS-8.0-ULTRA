CRITICAL NOTE: The exact breakdown of Chemistry and English is not
clearly specified in the official document for MPC stream. The PDF shows
\'Chemistry: 15\' and \'English: 25\' for MEC stream. For MPC stream
B.Sc courses, the distribution shows Maths: 20, Physics: 15, with
remaining 15 questions distributed between Chemistry and English.
Further verification may be needed for exact Chemistry vs English split.

1.3 Selection Process (OFFICIALLY VERIFIED)

The selection process at Loyola Academy involves multiple stages, each
of which is mandatory for admission. The official documents clearly
state the process, and this information has been cross-verified from
multiple sources including the official notification and careers360.com.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Stage**         **Weightage**     **Details**
  ----------------- ----------------- -----------------------------------

*Table 3: Complete Selection Process*

**CRITICAL FINDING FROM OFFICIAL SOURCE: The careers360 website states:
\'Admission would be taken on the basis of an entrance exam followed by
an interview. It is mandatory for the parents to accompany the candidate
for the interview.\' This means parent presence is NOT optional - it is
a REQUIREMENT. Any preparation plan that does not include parent
preparation is INCOMPLETE.**

1.4 Eligibility Criteria (OFFICIALLY VERIFIED)

-   Minimum 55% marks in Intermediate (10+2) for most B.Sc CS programs
    (some require 60%)

-   MPC stream (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry) required for B.Sc
    Computer Science

-   Only April/May 2025 passouts eligible (first attempt students)

-   Non-State Board students can apply with Class XI marks when XII
    result is awaited

PART 2: CRITICAL FLAWS IN PREVIOUS AI CONVERSATIONS

The following section identifies specific errors, assumptions, and
logical gaps in the previous AI conversation data provided by the user.
Each flaw is documented with the incorrect claim, the verified correct
information, and the impact on the project.

2.1 MAJOR FLAW #1: Incorrect Exam Pattern

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Previous AI Claim**               **VERIFIED REALITY**
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  60 Marks Total                      50 Marks Total

  90 Minutes Duration                 50 Minutes Duration

  English 15 Marks separate           Chemistry + English = 15 Marks
                                      combined
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

*Table 4: Exam Pattern Correction*

**IMPACT: This is a CRITICAL error. The time per question changes from
1.5 minutes (90 min / 60 Q) to 1 minute (50 min / 50 Q). This 33%
reduction in time per question fundamentally changes the preparation
strategy. Speed becomes even more critical, and deep problem-solving
approaches become impractical for the actual exam.**

2.2 MAJOR FLAW #2: Over-Engineering Self-Modifying Code

Previous AI conversations proposed: Genetic algorithms for strategy
evolution, Reinforcement learning for timing optimization,
Self-modifying Python code that rewrites itself, Facial expression
analysis via front camera, Touch pattern analysis for mood detection.

VERIFIED REALITY: While these concepts are scientifically valid, they
are PRACTICALLY IMPRactical for a 90-day project. Here is why: (1)
Genetic algorithms require hundreds of iterations to converge - 90 days
is insufficient. (2) RL needs thousands of interactions to learn -
single user cannot provide enough data. (3) Self-modifying code
introduces instability and debugging nightmares. (4) Facial analysis on
Android via Termux is computationally expensive and inaccurate. (5)
Touch patterns are not reliable indicators of psychological state.

**CORRECT APPROACH: Use a pre-tuned expert system with proven strategies
instead of attempting to evolve strategies. Focus on practical,
implementable features that work reliably on Day 1, not features that
might work after weeks of training.**

2.3 MAJOR FLAW #3: Interview and Parent Preparation Missing

Previous AI conversations mentioned interview only as an afterthought or
added it in later versions. The JARVIS 5.0 and 6.0 plans focused almost
exclusively on entrance exam preparation.

VERIFIED REALITY: Interview is MANDATORY and parents MUST accompany the
candidate. This is not optional. A student who scores 50/50 in the
entrance but fails the interview will NOT get admission. The interview
preparation must be integrated into the 90-day plan from the beginning,
not added as an afterthought.

2.4 MAJOR FLAW #4: Unrealistic Time Expectations

Previous AI conversations proposed 10 hours/day study from Day 1 for a
student starting from absolute zero. Some suggested starting with 6-7
hours and increasing later.

VERIFIED REALITY: Burnout is a real risk. Starting with 10 hours/day
from absolute zero will likely lead to exhaustion within 2-3 weeks. The
correct approach is: Week 1-2: 6-7 hours/day (building habit), Week 3-4:
8 hours/day (increasing intensity), Week 5 onwards: 8-10 hours/day (peak
performance). The AI must monitor for burnout signs and adjust
automatically.

2.5 MAJOR FLAW #5: Unverified Topic Frequency Data

Previous AI conversations claimed specific topic frequencies like
\'Matrices: 5.5/6 frequency\' and \'Differentiation: 5/6 frequency\'
without providing source verification.

VERIFIED REALITY: These frequencies were ASSUMED, not verified from
actual previous year papers. The correct approach is to collect
2019-2024 papers and manually tag each question to build a verified
frequency database. Any plan built on assumed frequencies is potentially
misleading.

    maintenance nightmare

PART 4: EVIDENCE-BASED LEARNING TECHNIQUES - SCIENTIFICALLY VERIFIED

The following learning techniques have been verified through scientific
research published in peer-reviewed journals and educational
institutions. Each technique is documented with its mechanism of action
and practical implementation strategy.

4.1 Active Recall (VERIFIED - HIGH EFFECTIVENESS)

Definition: The practice of actively stimulating memory during the
learning process by attempting to recall information without referring
to source materials. Instead of passively re-reading, the learner forces
their brain to retrieve information from memory.

Scientific Basis: Research published in Psychological Science
demonstrates that retrieval practice strengthens neural pathways and
improves long-term retention significantly more than passive review. The
act of struggling to recall information creates stronger memory traces
than simply recognizing it.

Implementation in JARVIS: After each study session, the system presents
3-5 questions on the material without allowing access to notes. The
student must attempt to answer before any reference is shown. Wrong
answers trigger immediate review of the specific concept, not the entire
topic.

4.2 Spaced Repetition (VERIFIED - HIGH EFFECTIVENESS)

Definition: A learning technique that incorporates increasing intervals
of time between subsequent review of previously learned material.
Instead of cramming, review sessions are spaced out over days, weeks,
and months.

Scientific Basis: The forgetting curve (Ebbinghaus, 1885) demonstrates
that memory decays exponentially over time. Spaced repetition interrupts
this decay at optimal intervals. Research by Cepeda et al. (2006) shows
that spaced repetition can improve long-term retention by up to 200%
compared to massed practice.

Implementation in JARVIS: The SM-2 algorithm (used by Anki) is
implemented with modifications for exam preparation. After a topic is
first learned, review is scheduled at: 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days,
30 days. If the student fails a review, the interval resets. This
ensures topics are reviewed just before they would be forgotten.

4.3 Interleaving (VERIFIED - MEDIUM-HIGH EFFECTIVENESS)

Definition: A practice technique where different topics or types of
problems are mixed together in a single study session, rather than being
studied in blocked sequences.

Scientific Basis: Research shows that interleaving forces the brain to
constantly switch between different problem types, improving the ability
to discriminate between concepts and select appropriate strategies. This
mirrors the actual exam condition where questions from different topics
appear randomly.

Implementation in JARVIS: Practice sessions after Week 4 use interleaved
question sets. Instead of 20 questions on one topic, each practice set
contains 5 questions each from 4 different topics. This prepares the
student for the actual exam where questions from Maths, Physics, and
Chemistry appear in mixed order.

4.4 The 6 Strategies for Effective Learning

The Learning Scientists (learningscientists.org) have identified 6
evidence-based strategies for effective learning, all of which are
incorporated into JARVIS:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Strategy**      **Description**            **JARVIS Implementation**
