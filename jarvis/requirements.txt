# JARVIS Dependencies - EXACT VERSIONS
# =====================================
# Reason: Version pinning ensures reproducible builds
# Rollback: Delete virtualenv and recreate if dependency conflicts occur

# === CORE FRAMEWORK ===
textual==0.47.1          # TUI Framework - async, CSS styling, well-documented
                         # Reason: Best TUI framework for Python, actively maintained
                         # Alternative rejected: Rich (non-interactive), Curses (low-level)

# === DATABASE ===
# SQLite is built into Python, no external dependency needed
# Reason: Single file, no server, perfect for mobile
# aiosqlite for async operations
aiosqlite==0.19.0        # Async SQLite wrapper
                         # Reason: Textual is async, need async DB operations

# === AI/ML ===
# No Python ML dependencies - llama.cpp is standalone binary
# Reason: Running model inference via subprocess to llama.cpp binary
# This saves memory and is faster than Python ML frameworks on mobile

# === UTILITIES ===
python-dateutil==2.8.2   # Date/time utilities
                         # Reason: SM-2 algorithm needs date calculations

pydantic==2.5.3          # Data validation
                         # Reason: Type-safe configuration, runtime validation

# === TESTING ===
pytest==7.4.3            # Testing framework
pytest-asyncio==0.21.1   # Async test support

# === LOGGING ===
# Python's built-in logging is sufficient
# No external dependency needed

# === DEVELOPMENT ===
black==23.12.1           # Code formatter (optional, for development)

# =====================================
# TOTAL DEPENDENCIES: 7 (minimal, deliberate)
# Each dependency has a specific purpose
# No unnecessary packages
